<span>**About Me**</span>

I am Peng Pei, a Ph.D. student at [the College of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nuaa.edu.cn/)
, [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/)
, supervised by [Prof. Sheng-Jun Huang](https://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/huangsj/)
 in the Weakly Supervised Learning Laboratory.

Before starting my Ph.D. in April 2024, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from NUAA in 2020 and my M.S. degree in 2023. 
After completing my master’s studies, I spent a short research period in the Weakly Supervised Learning Laboratory during my gap stage before entering the Ph.D. program.

<span>**Research Interest**</span>

My research focuses on model reliability and interpretability in complex and open environments. Currently, I am particularly interested in combining causal inference with large vision–language models to address issues such as hallucinations and shortcut dependencies under distribution shifts. In addition, I also work on class imbalance, multi-label learning, and scene graph generation.

I am open to research collaborations, and welcome anyone interested to contact me via email.
