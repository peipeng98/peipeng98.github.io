Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

<span>**About Me**</span>

I am Peng Pei, a Ph.D. student at [the College of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nuaa.edu.cn/)
, [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/)
, supervised by [Prof. Sheng-Jun Huang](https://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/huangsj/)
 in the Weakly Supervised Learning Laboratory.

Before starting my Ph.D. in April 2024, I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from NUAA in 2020 and my M.S. degree in 2023. 
After completing my master’s studies, I spent a short research period in the Weakly Supervised Learning Laboratory during my gap stage before entering the Ph.D. program.


<!-- <span style="color: blue;">**Research Interest**</span> -->
<span>**Research Interest**</span>

My research focuses on model reliability and interpretability in complex and open environments. Currently, I am particularly interested in combining causal inference with large vision–language models to address issues such as hallucinations and shortcut dependencies under distribution shifts. In addition, I also work on class imbalance, multi-label learning, and scene graph generation.

I am open to research collaborations, and welcome anyone interested to contact me via email.
